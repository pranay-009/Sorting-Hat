                <p class="contract-text">
                <p class="contract-text">
                    THIS AGREEMENT is entered into voluntarily, knowingly, and with full awareness of
                    the consequences of prolonged association.
                    <br><br>
                    By proceeding, the Undersigned acknowledges that A Horcrux has, in fact, been
                    created. Not through dark magic, not through intention, but through repeated
                    exposure to shared jokes and unfinished sentences.
                    <br><br>
                    Said Horcrux — hereafter referred to as “Us” — shall be protected at all times from: Basilisks
                    (symbolic or otherwise), Dementors (including bad days and overthinking), Fiendfyre (dramatic
                    escalation), and outside interference from Muggles who “don’t get it”.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>🪄 Article I — Lifetime of Shenanigans</strong>
                    <br>
                    By agreeing to this contract, you bind yourself to: A lifetime of harmless chaos, occasional
                    mispronunciations (corrected Sometimes, Not all the time Please don't make it annoying), songs
                    sung
                    confidently and incorrectly, and unsolicited Bollywood references deployed in moments of
                    emotional
                    vulnerability.
                    <br>
                    Resistance is futile. Counter-spells are ineffective.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>🪄 Article II — In the Event of Emotional Distress</strong>
                    <br>
                    Should either party experience any emotional distress, it
                    is the immediate duty of the other to: Cast Expecto Patronum (reassurance), perform one (1)
                    goofy act to induce laughter, and use excessive charm until stability is restored.
                    <br>
                    Failure to comply may result in dramatic staring or worse… silence!
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>🪄 Article III — Termination Clause</strong>
                    <br>
                    There is none. This contract cannot be destroyed by Sword of Gryffindor, Basilisk fang,
                    Fiendfyre,
                    or strategic legal interpretation.
                    <br>
                    The Horcrux exists. And it is well protected.
